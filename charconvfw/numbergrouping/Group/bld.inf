// specify the .mmp files required for building the important component releasables

// It's best if the .MMP files are specified in the order in which the components are
// built, but that eventually shouldn't matter
//
// Use C++ style #defines to denote that a component is only built for a particular platform
//
// specify "tidy" if the component you need to build doesn't need to be released to
// the rest of the company
// specify "ignore" if the MMP file exists but should be ignored - William wants this!
